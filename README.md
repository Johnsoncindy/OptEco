### Project Overview

OptEco uses predictive analytics to optimize energy consumption by forecasting usage patterns, suggesting efficient usage schedules, and integrating renewable energy sources. The platform is designed to operate on both a web app (Next.js) and a mobile app (React Native), giving users flexibility in monitoring and controlling energy usage.

### Tech Stack

- *Frontend (Web)*: Next.js, Chakra UI
- *Frontend (Mobile)*: React Native
- *Backend*: Node.js with Express
- *Database*: PostgreSQL, Google BigQuery for large-scale data analytics
- *AI and Analytics*: Google Cloud Vertex AI (with Google Gemini API)
- *Notifications*: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Twilio

### Core Features

- *Energy Usage Forecasting*: Predicts future energy usage based on historical data and environmental factors.
- *Optimization Recommendations*: Personalized tips for reducing energy consumption.
- *Smart Scheduling*: Automate schedules for appliances to optimize energy usage.
- *Cost Savings Tracking*: View periodic savings reports based on optimizations.
- *Renewable Integration*: Prioritizes renewable energy sources for users with solar setups.

### Using the Google Gemini API

OptEco uses the Google Gemini API to access advanced machine learning models for:
- *Time-Series Forecasting*: Generate energy usage forecasts based on historical patterns.
- *Optimization*: Recommend energy-saving actions based on consumption data.

To get started, ensure your Google Cloud Vertex AI API is enabled. Add your Gemini API key to the environment variables.
